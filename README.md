Below we will outline instructions to create a simple choropleth map of cases. we will walk through exporting data manually from Go.Data, reformatting in Excel, and cleaning, aggregating and mapping case data in QGIS, an open source GIS application.

This is not meant to be a complete tutorial on how to make maps or use QGIS - this guide assumes you have some experience with QGIS and/or mapping. The guide uses a polygon GIS dataset (shapefile) with a unique identifier field that matches the unique identifier (Location_ID) of the case data exported from Go.Data. For sources of GIS data please see our section [? add the link where the different location data sources are mentioned].
