The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) HDX is managed by the United Nations Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data. It is an open platform for humanitarian data which is designed so that data is easy to find and can be downloaded and used for analysis.

NOTE: This is a voluntary clearinghouse for data therefore the data availability, admin levels and format vary by country. In some cases, it is only available in GIS format, in those cases someone with GIS skills may need to clean and/or format it to Go.Data requirements. https://data.humdata.org/
